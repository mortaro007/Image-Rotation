# Image-Rotation

A small but yet useful little app that I made for a course at my University. It implements all OOP principles, having an interface, multiple class inheritance, abstract classes, varargs, exceptions handling and multithreading.

You will need to specify the input and output name of the image that will be processed, and also the number of degrees which the image will be rotated with (90, 180 or 270).

The program can run in 2 ways:
  - With arguments, inserted in the Run Configuration
  - Withour arguments, which will be inserted through the terminal
  - Important: The arguments will be writen in this exact order (img_input, img_output, degrees_no)
